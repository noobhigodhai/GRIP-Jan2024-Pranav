# GRIP-Jan2024-Pranav Task-6
Code for the prediction of class of Iris Flowers using Decision Tree Algorithm.

The project aims to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating a Decision Tree classifier on the Iris dataset.
The model performance is calculated using metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix, providing insights into how well the 
model can classify different species of iris flowers based on their features. The Decision Tree visualization enhances the
interpretability of the model.
